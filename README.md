# Planets

Planets is a simple project I did for fun, where I created a website that runs a simulation of the solar system. Feel free to fork this repository and improve upon what I've done.

Currently, the server-side code written in Python isn't 100% functional. Nevertheless, the frontend code seems to be working perfectly.
